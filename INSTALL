Building CannaCoin

I Googled a ton of stuff and spent too long on the PC using too many virtual hosts...So have fun.
See doc/readme-qt.rst for instructions on building CannaCoin-QT,
the intended-for-end-users, nice-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of CannaCoin.

See doc/build-*.txt for instructions on building cannacoind,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of CannaCoin.
