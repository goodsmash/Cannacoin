Since California passed an initiative to allow medical cannabis in 1996, multiple states have passed similar initiatives. We now have full blown legalization! Colorado voters' approval in now in effect after amendeding the stateâ€™s constitution to allow the retail sale of recreational cannabis.

It has become increasingly difficult to deposit funds for cannabis businesses due to deposit restrictions by centralized financial institutions. Those days are no more with the advent of CannaCoin.

As a decentralized crypto currency, CannaCoin offers the solution to help fill this void. Consider CannaCoin as a universal payment that is easily transferable between cannabis business owners throughout the industry. Imagine using CannaCoin at your favorite dispensary as a patient! How about a business that needs marketing assistance in the industry? 

CannaCoin is an open source, peer-to-peer Internet currency specifically designed for the emerging cannabis industry. It is a platform independent crypto currency that is easily transferable between the entire industry. CannaCoin can simply be summed up as the future of cannabis.

By itself, CannaCoin has no value. On the exchanges, CannaCoin is worth what the market values it at and it can be bought, sold and exchanged to fiat currencies such as US dollars or exchanged to other crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.

CannaCoin is based on the strengths of crypto currency protocols such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Feathercoin and s ome of digitalcoin, giving it a second movers advantage. It leverages the security of Bitcoin, the accessibility of Litecoin, the abundance of Feathercoin, and the speed of digitalcoin. While CannaCoin can be used as a general purpose currency, it serves a specific purpose and is marketed exclusively for the cannabis industry for business purposes.
